    this topic describes the graphics-file formats used by the microsoft windows<br>
    operating system. graphics files include bitmap files, icon-resource files,<br>
    and cursor-resource files.<br>
    <br>
    bitmap-file formats<br>
    <br>
    windows bitmap files are stored in a device-independent bitmap (dib) format<br>
    that allows windows to display the bitmap on any type of display device. the<br>
    term &quot;device independent&quot; means that the bitmap specifies pixel color in a<br>
    form independent of the method used by a display to represent color. the<br>
    default filename extension of a windows dib file is .bmp.<br>
    <br>
    bitmap-file structures<br>
    <br>
    each bitmap file contains a bitmap-file header, a bitmap-information header,<br>
    a color table, and an array of bytes that defines the bitmap bits. the file<br>
    has the following form:<br>
    <br>
    bitmapfileheader bmfh;<br>
    bitmapinfoheader bmih;<br>
    rgbquad acolors[];<br>
    byte abitmapbits[];<br>
    <br>
    the bitmap-file header contains information about the type, size, and layout<br>
    of a device-independent bitmap file. the header is defined as a<br>
    bitmapfileheader structure.<br>
    <br>
    the bitmap-information header, defined as a bitmapinfoheader structure,<br>
    specifies the dimensions, compression type, and color format for the bitmap.<br>
    <br>
    the color table, defined as an array of rgbquad structures, contains as many<br>
    elements as there are colors in the bitmap. the color table is not present<br>
    for bitmaps with 24 color bits because each pixel is represented by 24-bit<br>
    red-green-blue (rgb) values in the actual bitmap data area. the colors in the<br>
    table should appear in order of importance. this helps a display driver<br>
    render a bitmap on a device that cannot display as many colors as there are<br>
    in the bitmap. if the dib is in windows version 3.0 or later format, the<br>
    driver can use the biclrimportant member of the bitmapinfoheader structure to<br>
    determine which colors are important.<br>
    <br>
    the bitmapinfo structure can be used to represent a combined<br>
    bitmap-information header and color table. the bitmap bits, immediately<br>
    following the color table, consist of an array of byte values representing<br>
    consecutive rows, or &quot;scan lines,&quot; of the bitmap. each scan line consists of<br>
    consecutive bytes representing the pixels in the scan line, in left-to-right<br>
    order. the number of bytes representing a scan line depends on the color<br>
    format and the width, in pixels, of the bitmap. if necessary, a scan line<br>
    must be zero-padded to end on a 32-bit boundary. however, segment boundaries<br>
    can appear anywhere in the bitmap. the scan lines in the bitmap are stored<br>
    from bottom up. this means that the first byte in the array represents the<br>
    pixels in the lower-left corner of the bitmap and the last byte represents<br>
    the pixels in the upper-right corner.<br>
    <br>
    the bibitcount member of the bitmapinfoheader structure determines the number<br>
    of bits that define each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the<br>
    bitmap. these members can have any of the following values:<br>
    <br>
    value meaning<br>
    <br>
    1 bitmap is monochrome and the color table contains two entries. each<br>
    bit in the bitmap array represents a pixel. if the bit is clear, the pixel is<br>
    displayed with the color of the first entry in the color table. if the bit is<br>
    set, the pixel has the color of the second entry in the table.<br>
    <br>
    4 bitmap has a maximum of 16 colors. each pixel in the bitmap is<br>
    represented by a 4-bit index into the color table. for example, if the first<br>
    byte in the bitmap is 0x1f, the byte represents two pixels. the first pixel<br>
    contains the color in the second table entry, and the second pixel contains<br>
    the color in the sixteenth table entry.<br>
    <br>
    8 bitmap has a maximum of 256 colors. each pixel in the bitmap is<br>
    represented by a 1-byte index into the color table. for example, if the first<br>
    byte in the bitmap is 0x1f, the first pixel has the color of the<br>
    thirty-second table entry.<br>
    <br>
    24 bitmap has a maximum of 2^24 colors. the bmicolors (or bmcicolors)<br>
    member is null, and each 3-byte sequence in the bitmap array represents the<br>
    relative intensities of red, green, and blue, respectively, for a pixel.<br>
    <br>
    the biclrused member of the bitmapinfoheader structure specifies the number<br>
    of color indexes in the color table actually used by the bitmap. if the<br>
    biclrused member is set to zero, the bitmap uses the maximum number of colors<br>
    corresponding to the value of the bibitcount member. an alternative form of<br>
    bitmap file uses the bitmapcoreinfo, bitmapcoreheader, and rgbtriple<br>
    structures.<br>
    <br>
    bitmap compression<br>
    <br>
    windows versions 3.0 and later support run-length encoded (rle) formats for<br>
    compressing bitmaps that use 4 bits per pixel and 8 bits per pixel.<br>
    compression reduces the disk and memory storage required for a bitmap.<br>
    <br>
    compression of 8-bits-per-pixel bitmaps<br>
    <br>
    when the bicompression member of the bitmapinfoheader structure is set to<br>
    bi_rle8, the dib is compressed using a run-length encoded format for a<br>
    256-color bitmap. this format uses two modes: encoded mode and absolute mode.<br>
    both modes can occur anywhere throughout a single bitmap.<br>
    <br>
    encoded mode<br>
    <br>
    a unit of information in encoded mode consists of two bytes. the first byte<br>
    specifies the number of consecutive pixels to be drawn using the color index<br>
    contained in the second byte. the first byte of the pair can be set to zero<br>
    to indicate an escape that denotes the end of a line, the end of the bitmap,<br>
    or a delta. the interpretation of the escape depends on the value of the<br>
    second byte of the pair, which must be in the range 0x00 through 0x02.<br>
    following are the meanings of the escape values that can be used in the<br>
    second byte:<br>
    <br>
    second byte meaning<br>
    <br>
    0 end of line. <br>
    1 end of bitmap. <br>
    2 delta. the two bytes following the escape contain unsigned values<br>
    indicating the horizontal and vertical offsets of the next pixel from the<br>
    current position.<br>
    <br>
    absolute mode<br>
    <br>
    absolute mode is signaled by the first byte in the pair being set to zero and<br>
    the second byte to a value between 0x03 and 0xff. the second byte represents<br>
    the number of bytes that follow, each of which contains the color index of a<br>
    single pixel. each run must be aligned on a word boundary. following is an<br>
    example of an 8-bit rle bitmap (the two-digit hexadecimal values in the<br>
    second column represent a color index for a single pixel):<br>

    <br>
    compression of 4-bits-per-pixel bitmaps<br>
    <br>
    when the bicompression member of the bitmapinfoheader structure is set to<br>
    bi_rle4, the dib is compressed using a run-length encoded format for a<br>
    16-color bitmap. this format uses two modes: encoded mode and absolute mode.<br>
    <br>
    encoded mode<br>
    <br>
    a unit of information in encoded mode consists of two bytes. the first byte<br>
    of the pair contains the number of pixels to be drawn using the color indexes<br>
    in the second byte.<br>
    <br>
    the second byte contains two color indexes, one in its high-order nibble<br>
    (that is, its low-order 4 bits) and one in its low-order nibble.<br>
    <br>
    the first pixel is drawn using the color specified by the high-order nibble,<br>
    the second is drawn using the color in the low-order nibble, the third is<br>
    drawn with the color in the high-order nibble, and so on, until all the<br>
    pixels specified by the first byte have been drawn.<br>
    <br>
    the first byte of the pair can be set to zero to indicate an escape that<br>
    denotes the end of a line, the end of the bitmap, or a delta. the<br>
    interpretation of the escape depends on the value of the second byte of the<br>
    pair. in encoded mode, the second byte has a value in the range 0x00 through<br>
    0x02. the meaning of these values is the same as for a dib with 8 bits per<br>
    pixel.<br>
    <br>
    absolute mode<br>
    <br>
    in absolute mode, the first byte contains zero, the second byte contains the<br>
    number of color indexes that follow, and subsequent bytes contain color<br>
    indexes in their high- and low-order nibbles, one color index for each pixel.<br>
    each run must be aligned on a word boundary.<br>
    <br>
    following is an example of a 4-bit rle bitmap (the one-digit hexadecimal<br>
    values in the second column represent a color index for a single pixel):<br>
    <br>
    compressed data expanded data<br>

    icon-resource file format<br>
    <br>
    an icon-resource file contains image data for icons used by windows<br>
    applications. the file consists of an icon directory identifying the number<br>
    and types of icon images in the file, plus one or more icon images. the<br>
    default filename extension for an icon-resource file is .ico.<br>
    <br>
    icon directory<br>
    <br>
    each icon-resource file starts with an icon directory. the icon directory,<br>
    defined as an icondir structure, specifies the number of icons in the<br>
    resource and the dimensions and color format of each icon image. the icondir<br>
    structure has the following form:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    typedef struct icondir {<br>
    word idreserved;<br>
    word idtype;<br>
    word idcount;<br>
    icondirentry identries[1];<br>
    } iconheader;<br>
    <br>
    following are the members in the icondir structure:<br>
    <br>
    idreserved reserved; must be zero. <br>
    idtype specifies the resource type. this member is set to 1. <br>
    idcount specifies the number of entries in the directory. <br>
    identries specifies an array of icondirentry structures containing<br>
    information about individual icons. the idcount member specifies the number<br>
    of structures in the array.<br>
    <br>
    the icondirentry structure specifies the dimensions and color format for an<br>
    icon. the structure has the following form:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    struct icondirectoryentry {<br>
    byte bwidth;<br>
    byte bheight;<br>
    byte bcolorcount;<br>
    byte breserved;<br>
    word wplanes;<br>
    word wbitcount;<br>
    dword dwbytesinres;<br>
    dword dwimageoffset;<br>
    };<br>
    <br>
    following are the members in the icondirentry structure: <br>
    <br>
    bwidth specifies the width of the icon, in pixels. acceptable values<br>
    are 16, 32, and 64.<br>
    <br>
    bheight specifies the height of the icon, in pixels. acceptable<br>
    values are 16, 32, and 64.<br>
    <br>
    bcolorcount specifies the number of colors in the icon. acceptable values<br>
    are 2, 8, and 16.<br>
    <br>
    breserved reserved; must be zero. <br>
    wplanes specifies the number of color planes in the icon bitmap. <br>
    wbitcount specifies the number of bits in the icon bitmap. <br>
    dwbytesinres specifies the size of the resource, in bytes. <br>
    dwimageoffset specifies the offset, in bytes, from the beginning of the<br>
    file to the icon image.<br>
    <br>
    icon image<br>
    <br>
    each icon-resource file contains one icon image for each image identified in<br>
    the icon directory. an icon image consists of an icon-image header, a color<br>
    table, an xor mask, and an and mask. the icon image has the following form:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    bitmapinfoheader icheader;<br>
    rgbquad iccolors[];<br>
    byte icxor[];<br>
    byte icand[];<br>
    <br>
    the icon-image header, defined as a bitmapinfoheader structure, specifies the<br>
    dimensions and color format of the icon bitmap. only the bisize through<br>
    bibitcount members and the bisizeimage member are used. all other members<br>
    (such as bicompression and biclrimportant) must be set to zero.<br>
    <br>
    the color table, defined as an array of rgbquad structures, specifies the<br>
    colors used in the xor mask. as with the color table in a bitmap file, the<br>
    bibitcount member in the icon-image header determines the number of elements<br>
    in the array. for more information about the color table, see section 1.1,<br>
    &quot;bitmap-file formats.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    the xor mask, immediately following the color table, is an array of byte<br>
    values representing consecutive rows of a bitmap. the bitmap defines the<br>
    basic shape and color of the icon image. as with the bitmap bits in a bitmap<br>
    file, the bitmap data in an icon-resource file is organized in scan lines,<br>
    with each byte representing one or more pixels, as defined by the color<br>
    format. for more information about these bitmap bits, see section 1.1,<br>
    &quot;bitmap-file formats.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    the and mask, immediately following the xor mask, is an array of byte values,<br>
    representing a monochrome bitmap with the same width and height as the xor<br>
    mask. the array is organized in scan lines, with each byte representing 8<br>
    pixels.<br>
    <br>
    when windows draws an icon, it uses the and and xor masks to combine the icon<br>
    image with the pixels already on the display surface. windows first applies<br>
    the and mask by using a bitwise and operation; this preserves or removes<br>
    existing pixel color. windows then applies the xor mask by using a bitwise<br>
    xor operation. this sets the final color for each pixel.<br>
    <br>
    the following illustration shows the xor and and masks that create a<br>
    monochrome icon (measuring 8 pixels by 8 pixels) in the form of an uppercase<br>
    k:<br>
    <br>
    windows icon selection<br>
    <br>
    windows detects the resolution of the current display and matches it against<br>
    the width and height specified for each version of the icon image. if windows<br>
    determines that there is an exact match between an icon image and the current<br>
    device, it uses the matching image. otherwise, it selects the closest match<br>
    and stretches the image to the proper size.<br>
    <br>
    if an icon-resource file contains more than one image for a particular<br>
    resolution, windows uses the icon image that most closely matches the color<br>
    capabilities of the current display. if no image matches the device<br>
    capabilities exactly, windows selects the image that has the greatest number<br>
    of colors without exceeding the number of display colors. if all images<br>
    exceed the color capabilities of the current display, windows uses the icon<br>
    image with the least number of colors.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    cursor-resource file format<br>
    <br>
    a cursor-resource file contains image data for cursors used by windows<br>
    applications. the file consists of a cursor directory identifying the number<br>
    and types of cursor images in the file, plus one or more cursor images. the<br>
    default filename extension for a cursor-resource file is .cur.<br>
    <br>
    cursor directory<br>
    <br>
    each cursor-resource file starts with a cursor directory. the cursor<br>
    directory, defined as a cursordir structure, specifies the number of cursors<br>
    in the file and the dimensions and color format of each cursor image. the<br>
    cursordir structure has the following form:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    typedef struct _cursordir {<br>
    word cdreserved;<br>
    word cdtype;<br>
    word cdcount;<br>
    cursordirentry cdentries[];<br>
    } cursordir;<br>
    <br>
    following are the members in the cursordir structure: <br>
    <br>
    cdreserved reserved; must be zero. <br>
    cdtype specifies the resource type. this member must be set to 2. <br>
    cdcount specifies the number of cursors in the file. <br>
    cdentries specifies an array of cursordirentry structures containing<br>
    information about individual cursors. the cdcount member specifies the number<br>
    of structures in the array.<br>
    <br>
    a cursordirentry structure specifies the dimensions and color format of a<br>
    cursor image. the structure has the following form:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    typedef struct _cursordirentry {<br>
    byte bwidth;<br>
    byte bheight;<br>
    byte bcolorcount;<br>
    byte breserved;<br>
    word wxhotspot;<br>
    word wyhotspot;<br>
    dword lbytesinres;<br>
    dword dwimageoffset;<br>
    } cursordirentry;<br>
    <br>
    following are the members in the cursordirentry structure: <br>
    <br>
    bwidth specifies the width of the cursor, in pixels. <br>
    bheight specifies the height of the cursor, in pixels. <br>
    bcolorcount reserved; must be zero. <br>
    breserved reserved; must be zero.<br>
    wxhotspot specifies the x-coordinate, in pixels, of the hot spot. <br>
    wyhotspot specifies the y-coordinate, in pixels, of the hot spot. <br>
    lbytesinres specifies the size of the resource, in bytes. <br>
    dwimageoffset specifies the offset, in bytes, from the start of the file to<br>
    the cursor image.<br>
    <br>
    cursor image<br>
    <br>
    each cursor-resource file contains one cursor image for each image identified<br>
    in the cursor directory. a cursor image consists of a cursor-image header, a<br>
    color table, an xor mask, and an and mask. the cursor image has the following<br>
    form:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    bitmapinfoheader crheader;<br>
    rgbquad crcolors[];<br>
    byte crxor[];<br>
    byte crand[];<br>
    <br>
    the cursor hot spot is a single pixel in the cursor bitmap that windows uses<br>
    to track the cursor. the crxhotspot and cryhotspot members specify the x- and<br>
    y-coordinates of the cursor hot spot. these coordinates are 16-bit integers.<br>
    <br>
    the cursor-image header, defined as a bitmapinfoheader structure, specifies<br>
    the dimensions and color format of the cursor bitmap. only the bisize through<br>
    bibitcount members and the bisizeimage member are used. the biheight member<br>
    specifies the combined height of the xor and and masks for the cursor. this<br>
    value is twice the height of the xor mask. the biplanes and bibitcount<br>
    members must be 1. all other members (such as bicompression and<br>
    biclrimportant) must be set to zero.<br>
    <br>
    the color table, defined as an array of rgbquad structures, specifies the<br>
    colors used in the xor mask. for a cursor image, the table contains exactly<br>
    two structures, since the bibitcount member in the cursor-image header is<br>
    always 1.<br>
    <br>
    the xor mask, immediately following the color table, is an array of byte<br>
    values representing consecutive rows of a bitmap. the bitmap defines the<br>
    basic shape and color of the cursor image. as with the bitmap bits in a<br>
    bitmap file, the bitmap data in a cursor-resource file is organized in scan<br>
    lines, with each byte representing one or more pixels, as defined by the<br>
    color format. for more information about these bitmap bits, see section 1.1,<br>

    the and mask, immediately following the xor mask, is an array of byte values<br>
    representing a monochrome bitmap with the same width and height as the xor<br>
    mask. the array is organized in scan lines, with each byte representing 8<br>
    pixels.<br>
    <br>
    when windows draws a cursor, it uses the and and xor masks to combine the<br>
    cursor image with the pixels already on the display surface. windows first<br>
    applies the and mask by using a bitwise and operation; this preserves or<br>
    removes existing pixel color. window then applies the xor mask by using a<br>
    bitwise xor operation. this sets the final color for each pixel.<br>
    <br>
    the following illustration shows the xor and the and masks that create a<br>
    cursor (measuring 8 pixels by 8 pixels) in the form of an arrow:<br>

    <br>
    a windows 3.0 or later dib consists of two distinct parts: a bitmapinfo<br>
    structure, which describes the dimensions and colors of the bitmap, and an<br>
    array of bytes defining the pixels of the bitmap. the bits in the array are<br>
    packed together, but each scan line must be zero-padded to end on a long<br>
    boundary. segment boundaries, however, can appear anywhere in the bitmap. the<br>
    origin of the bitmap is the lower-left corner.<br>
    <br>
    the bibitcount member of the bitmapinfoheader structure determines the number<br>
    of bits which define each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the<br>
    bitmap. this member may be set to any of the following values:<br>
    <br>
    value meaning<br>
    <br>
    1 the bitmap is monochrome, and the bmcicolors member must contain two<br>
    entries. each bit in the bitmap array represents a pixel. if the bit is<br>
    clear, the pixel is displayed with the color of the first entry in the<br>
    bmcicolors table. if the bit is set, the pixel has the color of the second<br>
    entry in the table.<br>
    <br>
    4 the bitmap has a maximum of 16 colors, and the bmcicolors member<br>
    contains 16 entries. each pixel in the bitmap is represented by a four-bit<br>
    index into the color table.<br>
    <br>
    for example, if the first byte in the bitmap is 0x1f, the byte represents two<br>
    pixels. the first pixel contains the color in the second table entry, and the<br>
    second pixel contains the color in the sixteenth table entry.<br>
    <br>
    8 the bitmap has a maximum of 256 colors, and the bmcicolors member<br>
    contains 256 entries. in this case, each byte in the array represents a<br>
    single pixel.<br>
    <br>
    24 the bitmap has a maximum of 2^24 colors. the bmcicolors member is<br>
    null, and each 3-byte sequence in the bitmap array represents the relative<br>
    intensities of red, green, and blue, respectively, of a pixel.<br>
    <br>
    the biclrused member of the bitmapinfoheader structure specifies the number<br>
    of color indexes in the color table actually used by the bitmap. if the<br>
    biclrused member is set to zero, the bitmap uses the maximum number of colors<br>
    corresponding to the value of the bibitcount member.<br>
    <br>
    the colors in the bmicolors table should appear in order of importance.<br>
    alternatively, for functions that use dibs, the bmicolors member can be an<br>
    array of 16-bit unsigned integers that specify an index into the currently<br>
    realized logical palette instead of explicit rgb values. in this case, an<br>
    application using the bitmap must call dib functions with the wusage<br>
    parameter set to dib_pal_colors.<br>
    <br>
    note: the bmicolors member should not contain palette indexes if the bitmap<br>
    is to be stored in a file or transferred to another application. unless the<br>
    application uses the bitmap exclusively and under its complete control, the<br>
    bitmap color table should contain explicit rgb values.<br>

    for more information on the maximum sizes of the color table, see the<br>

    member is less than 24. if bibitcount is set to 24, biclrused specifies the<br>
    size of the reference color table used to optimize performance of windows<br>
    color palettes. if the bitmap is a packed bitmap (that is, a bitmap in which<br>

    the bitmapinfo structure combines the bitmapinfoheader structure and a color<br>
    table to provide a complete definition of the dimensions and colors of a<br>
    windows 3.0 or later dib. for more information about specifying a windows 3.0<br>
    dib, see the description of the bitmapinfo structure.<br>
    <br>
    an application should use the information stored in the bisize member to<br>
    locate the color table in a bitmapinfo structure as follows:<br>
    <br>
    pcolor = ((lpstr) pbitmapinfo + (word) (pbitmapinfo-&gt;bmiheader.bisize))<br>
    <br>
    windows supports formats for compressing bitmaps that define their colors<br>
    with 8 bits per pixel and with 4 bits per pixel. compression reduces the disk<br>
    and memory storage required for the bitmap. the following paragraphs describe<br>
    these formats.<br>
    <br>
    bi_rle8<br>
    <br>
    when the bicompression member is set to bi_rle8, the bitmap is compressed<br>
    using a run-length encoding format for an 8-bit bitmap. this format may be<br>
    compressed in either of two modes: encoded and absolute. both modes can occur<br>
    anywhere throughout a single bitmap.<br>
    <br>
    encoded mode consists of two bytes: the first byte specifies the number of<br>
    consecutive pixels to be drawn using the color index contained in the second<br>
    byte. in addition, the first byte of the pair can be set to zero to indicate<br>
    an escape that denotes an end of line, end of bitmap, or a delta. the<br>
    interpretation of the escape depends on the value of the second byte of the<br>
    pair. the following list shows the meaning of the second byte:<br>
    <br>
    value meaning<br>
    <br>
    0 end of line. <br>
    1 end of bitmap. <br>
    2 delta. the two bytes following the escape contain unsigned values<br>
    indicating the horizontal and vertical offset of the next pixel from the<br>
    current position.<br>
    <br>
    absolute mode is signaled by the first byte set to zero and the second byte<br>
    set to a value between 0x03 and 0xff. in absolute mode, the second byte<br>
    represents the number of bytes that follow, each of which contains the color<br>
    index of a single pixel. when the second byte is set to 2 or less, the escape<br>
    has the same meaning as in encoded mode. in absolute mode, each run must be<br>
    aligned on a word boundary. the following example shows the hexadecimal<br>
    values of an 8-bit compressed bitmap:<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    bi_rle4<br>
    <br>
    when the bicompression member is set to bi_rle4, the bitmap is compressed<br>
    using a run-length encoding (rle) format for a 4-bit bitmap, which also uses<br>
    encoded and absolute modes. in encoded mode, the first byte of the pair<br>
    contains the number of pixels to be drawn using the color indexes in the<br>
    second byte. the second byte contains two color indexes, one in its<br>
    high-order nibble (that is, its low-order four bits) and one in its low-order<br>
    nibble. the first of the pixels is drawn using the color specified by the<br>
    high-order nibble, the second is drawn using the color in the low-order<br>
    nibble, the third is drawn with the color in the high-order nibble, and so<br>
    on, until all the pixels specified by the first byte have been drawn. in<br>
    absolute mode, the first byte contains zero, the second byte contains the<br>
    number of color indexes that follow, and subsequent bytes contain color<br>
    indexes in their high- and low-order nibbles, one color index for each pixel.<br>
    in absolute mode, each run must be aligned on a word boundary. the<br>
    end-of-line, end-of-bitmap, and delta escapes also apply to bi_rle4.<br>

    the bitmapcoreinfo structure combines the bitmapcoreheader structure and a<br>
    color table to provide a complete definition of the dimensions and colors of<br>
    a dib. see the description of the bitmapcoreinfo structure for more<br>
    information about specifying a dib.<br>
    <br>
    an application should use the information stored in the bcsize member to<br>
    locate the color table in a bitmapcoreinfo structure with a method such as<br>
    the following:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    lpcolor = ((lpstr) pbitmapcoreinfo + (uint) (pbitmapcoreinfo-&gt;bcsize))<br>

    the rgbtriple structure describes a color consisting of relative intensities<br>
    of red, green, and blue. the bmcicolors member of the bitmapcoreinfo<br>
    structure consists of an array of rgbtriple structures. windows applications<br>
    should use the bitmapinfo structure instead of bitmapcoreinfo whenever<br>
    possible. the bitmapinfo structure uses an rgbquad structure instead of the<br>
    rgbtriple structure.<br>
