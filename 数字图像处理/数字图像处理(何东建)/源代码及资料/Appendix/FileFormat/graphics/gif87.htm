    introduction<br>
    'gif' (tm) is compuserve's standard for defining generalized color<br>
    raster images. this 'graphics interchange format' (tm) allows<br>
    high-quality, high-resolution graphics to be displayed on a variety of<br>
    graphics hardware and is intended as an exchange and display mechanism<br>
    for graphics images. the image format described in this document is<br>
    designed to support current and future image technology and will in<br>
    addition serve as a basis for future compuserve graphics products.<br>
    the main focus of this document is to provide the technical<br>
    information necessary for a programmer to implement gif encoders and<br>
    decoders. as such, some assumptions are made as to terminology relavent<br>
    to graphics and programming in general.<br>
    the first section of this document describes the gif data format<br>
    and its components and applies to all gif decoders, either as standalone<br>
    programs or as part of a communications package. appendix b is a<br>
    section relavent to decoders that are part of a communications software<br>
    package and describes the protocol requirements for entering and exiting<br>
    gif mode, and responding to host interrogations. a glossary in appendix<br>
    a defines some of the terminology used in this document. appendix c<br>
    gives a detailed explanation of how the graphics image itself is<br>
    packaged as a series of data bytes.<br>

    specification<br>
    gif signature<br>
    the following gif signature identifies the data following as a<br>
    valid gif image stream. it consists of the following six characters:<br>
    g i f 8 7 a<br>
    the last three characters '87a' may be viewed as a version number<br>
    for this particular gif definition and will be used in general as a<br>
    reference in documents regarding gif that address any version<br>
    dependencies.<br>
    screen descriptor<br>
    the screen descriptor describes the overall parameters for all gif<br>
    images following. it defines the overall dimensions of the image space<br>
    or logical screen required, the existance of color mapping information,<br>
    background../jpg/di1.JPGn color, and color depth information. this information<br>
    is stored in a series of 8-bit bytes as described below.<br>
    bits<br>
    7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 byte #<br>
    +---------------+<br>
    | | 1<br>
    +-screen width -+ raster width in pixels (lsb first)<br>
    | | 2<br>
    +---------------+<br>
    | | 3<br>
    +-screen height-+ raster height in pixels (lsb first)<br>
    | | 4<br>
    +-+-----+-+-----+ m = 1, global color map follows descriptor<br>
    |m| cr |0|pixel| 5 cr+1 = # bits of color resolution<br>
    +-+-----+-+-----+ pixel+1 = # bits/pixel in image<br>
    | background | 6 background=../jpg/di1.JPG index of screen background<br>
    +---------------+ (color is defined from the global color<br>
    |0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0| 7 map or default map if none specified)<br>
    +---------------+<br>
    the logical screen width and height can both be larger than the<br>
    physical display. how images larger than the physical display are<br>
    handled is implementation dependent and can take advantage of hardware<br>
    characteristics (e.g. macintosh scrolling windows). otherwise images<br>
    can be clipped to the edges of the display.<br>
    the value of 'pixel' also defines the maximum number of colors<br>
    within an image. the range of values for 'pixel' is 0 to 7 which<br>
    represents 1 to 8 bits. this translates to a range of 2 (b &amp; w) to 256<br>
    colors. bit 3 of word 5 is reserved for future definition and must be<br>
    zero.<br>
    graphics interchange format (gif) page 5<br>
    specification<br>
    global color map<br>
    the global color map is optional but recommended for images where<br>
    accurate color rendition is desired. the existence of this color map is<br>
    indicated in the 'm' field of byte 5 of the screen descriptor. a color<br>
    map can also be associated with each image in a gif file as described<br>
    later. however this global map will normally be used because of<br>
    hardware restrictions in equipment available today. in the individual<br>
    image descriptors the 'm' flag will normally be zero. if the global<br>
    color map is present, it's definition immediately follows the screen<br>
    descriptor. the number of color map entries following a screen<br>
    descriptor is equal to 2**(# bits per pixel), where each entry consists<br>
    of three byte values representing the relative intensities of red, green<br>
    and blue respectively. the structure of the color map block is:<br>
    bits<br>
    7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 byte #<br>
    +---------------+<br>
    | red intensity | 1 red value for color index 0<br>
    +---------------+<br>
    |green intensity| 2 green value for color index 0<br>
    +---------------+<br>
    | blue intensity| 3 blue value for color index 0<br>
    +---------------+<br>
    | red intensity | 4 red value for color index 1<br>
    +---------------+<br>
    |green intensity| 5 green value for color index 1<br>
    +---------------+<br>
    | blue intensity| 6 blue value for color index 1<br>
    +---------------+<br>
    : : (continues for remaining colors)<br>
    each image pixel value received will be displayed according to its<br>
    closest match with an available color of the display based on this color<br>
    map. the color components represent a fractional intensity value from<br>
    none (0) to full (255). white would be represented as (255,255,255),<br>
    black as (0,0,0) and medium yellow as (180,180,0). for display, if the<br>
    device supports fewer than 8 bits per color component, the higher order<br>
    bits of each component are used. in the creation of a gif color map<br>
    entry with hardware supporting fewer than 8 bits per component, the<br>
    component values for the hardware should be converted to the 8-bit<br>
    format with the following calculation:<br>
    &lt;map_value&gt; = &lt;component_value&gt;*255/(2**&lt;nbits&gt; -1)<br>
    this assures accurate translation of colors for all displays. in<br>
    the cases of creating gif images from hardware without color palette<br>
    capability, a fixed palette should be created based on the available<br>
    display colors for that hardware. if no global color map is indicated,<br>
    a default color map is generated internally which maps each possible<br>
    incoming color index to the same hardware color index modulo &lt;n&gt; where<br>
    &lt;n&gt; is the number of available hardware colors.<br>
    graphics interchange format (gif) page 6<br>
    specification<br>
    image descriptor<br>
    the image descriptor defines the actual placement and extents of<br>
    the following image within the space defined in the screen descriptor.<br>
    also defined are flags to indicate the presence of a local color lookup<br>
    map, and to define the pixel display sequence. each image descriptor is<br>
    introduced by an image separator character. the role of the image<br>
    separator is simply to provide a synchronization character to introduce<br>
    an image descriptor. this is desirable if a gif file happens to contain<br>
    more than one image. this character is defined as 0x2c hex or ','<br>
    (comma). when this character is encountered between images, the image<br>
    descriptor will follow immediately.<br>
    any characters encountered between the end of a previous image and<br>
    the image separator character are to be ignored. this allows future gif<br>
    enhancements to be present in newer image formats and yet ignored safely<br>
    by older software decoders.<br>

    +-+-+-+-+-+-----+ i=0 - image formatted in sequential order<br>
    i=1 - image formatted in interlaced order<br>
    pixel+1 - # bits per pixel for this image<br>
    the specifications for the image position and size must be confined<br>
    to the dimensions defined by the screen descriptor. on the other hand<br>
    it is not necessary that the image fill the entire screen defined.<br>
    local color map<br>
    graphics interchange format (gif) page 7<br>
    specification<br>
    a local color map is optional and defined here for future use. if<br>
    the 'm' bit of byte 10 of the image descriptor is set, then a color map<br>
    follows the image descriptor that applies only to the following image.<br>
    at the end of the image, the color map will revert to that defined after<br>
    the screen descriptor. note that the 'pixel' field of byte 10 of the<br>
    image descriptor is used only if a local color map is indicated. this<br>
    defines the parameters not only for the image pixel size, but determines<br>
    the number of color map entries that follow. the bits per pixel value<br>
    will also revert to the value specified in the screen descriptor when<br>
    processing of the image is complete.<br>
    raster data<br>
    the format of the actual image is defined as the series of pixel<br>
    color index values that make up the image. the pixels are stored left<br>
    to right sequentially for an image row. by default each image row is<br>
    written sequentially, top to bottom. in the case that the interlace or<br>
    'i' bit is set in byte 10 of the image descriptor then the row order of<br>
    the image display follows a four-pass process in which the image is<br>
    filled in by widely spaced rows. the first pass writes every 8th row,<br>
    starting with the top row of the image window. the second pass writes<br>
    every 8th row starting at the fifth row from the top. the third pass<br>
    writes every 4th row starting at the third row from the top. the fourth<br>
    pass completes the image, writing every other row, starting at the<br>
    second row from the top. a graphic description of this process follows:<br>
    image<br>
    row pass 1 pass 2 pass 3 pass 4 result<br>
    ---------------------------------------------------<br>
    0 **1a** **1a**<br>

    . . . <br>
    the image pixel values are processed as a series of color indices<br>
    which map into the existing color map. the resulting color value from<br>
    the map is what is actually displayed. this series of pixel indices,<br>
    the number of which is equal to image-width*image-height pixels, are<br>
    passed to the gif image data stream one value per pixel, compressed and<br>
    packaged according to a version of the lzw compression algorithm as<br>
    defined in appendix c.<br>
    graphics interchange format (gif) page 8<br>
    specification<br>
    gif terminator<br>
    in order to provide a synchronization for the termination of a gif<br>
    image file, a gif decoder will process the end of gif mode when the<br>
    character 0x3b hex or ';' is found after an image has been processed.<br>
    by convention the decoding software will pause and wait for an action<br>
    indicating that the user is ready to continue. this may be a carriage<br>
    return entered at the keyboard or a mouse click. for interactive<br>
    applications this user action must be passed on to the host as a<br>
    carriage return character so that the host application can continue.<br>
    the decoding software will then typically leave graphics mode and resume<br>
    any previous process.<br>
    gif extension blocks<br>
    to provide for orderly extension of the gif definition, a mechanism<br>
    for defining the packaging of extensions within a gif data stream is<br>
    necessary. specific gif extensions are to be defined and documented by<br>
    compuserve in order to provide a controlled enhancement path.<br>
    gif extension blocks are packaged in a manner similar to that used<br>
    by the raster data though not compressed. the basic structure is:<br>
    7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 byte #<br>
    +---------------+<br>
    |0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1| 1 '!' - gif extension block introducer<br>
    +---------------+<br>
    | function code | 2 extension function code (0 to 255)<br>
    +---------------+ ---+<br>
    | byte count | |<br>
    +---------------+ |<br>
    : : +-- repeated as many times as necessary<br>
    |func data bytes| |<br>
    : : |<br>
    +---------------+ ---+<br>
    . . . . . .<br>
    +---------------+<br>
    |0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0| zero byte count (terminates block)<br>
    +---------------+<br>
    a gif extension block may immediately preceed any image descriptor<br>
    or occur before the gif terminator.<br>
    all gif decoders must be able to recognize the existence of gif<br>
    extension blocks and read past them if unable to process the function<br>
    code. this ensures that older decoders will be able to process extended<br>
    gif image files in the future, though without the additional<br>
    functionality.<br>

    appendix a - glossary<br>
    glossary<br>
    pixel - the smallest picture element of a graphics image. this usually<br>
    corresponds to a single dot on a graphics screen. image resolution is<br>
    typically given in units of pixels. for example a fairly standard<br>
    graphics screen format is one 320 pixels across and 200 pixels high.<br>
    each pixel can appear as one of several colors depending on the<br>
    capabilities of the graphics hardware.<br>
    raster - a horizontal row of pixels representing one line of an image. a<br>
    typical method of working with images since most hardware is oriented to<br>
    work most efficiently in this manner.<br>
    lsb - least significant byte. refers to a convention for two byte numeric<br>
    values in which the less significant byte of the value preceeds the more<br>
    significant byte. this convention is typical on many microcomputers.<br>
    color map - the list of definitions of each color used in a gif image.<br>
    these desired colors are converted to available colors through a table<br>
    which is derived by assigning an incoming color index (from the image)<br>
    to an output color index (of the hardware). while the color map<br>
    definitons are specified in a gif image, the output pixel colors will<br>
    vary based on the hardware used and its ability to match the defined<br>
    color.<br>
    interlace - the method of displaying a gif image in which multiple passes<br>
    are made, outputting raster lines spaced apart to provide a way of<br>
    visualizing the general content of an entire image before all of the<br>
    data has been processed.<br>
    b protocol - a compuserve-developed error-correcting file transfer protocol<br>
    available in the public domain and implemented in compuserve vidtex<br>
    products. this error checking mechanism will be used in transfers of<br>
    gif images for interactive applications.<br>
    lzw - a sophisticated data compression algorithm based on work done by<br>
    lempel-ziv &amp; welch which has the feature of very efficient one-pass<br>
    encoding and decoding. this allows the image to be decompressed and<br>
    displayed at the same time. the original article from which this<br>
    technique was adapted is:<br>
    terry a. welch, &quot;a technique for high performance data<br>
    compression&quot;, ieee computer, vol 17 no 6 (june 1984)<br>
    this basic algorithm is also used in the public domain arc file<br>
    compression utilities. the compuserve adaptation of lzw for gif is<br>
    described in appendix c.<br>
    graphics interchange format (gif) page 10<br>
    appendix b - interactive sequences<br>
    gif sequence exchanges for an interactive environment<br>
    the following sequences are defined for use in mediating control<br>
    between a gif sender and gif receiver over an interactive communications<br>
    line. these sequences do not apply to applications that involve<br>
    downloading of static gif files and are not considered part of a gif<br>
    file.<br>
    gif capabilities enquiry<br>
    the gce sequence is issued from a host and requests an interactive<br>
    gif decoder to return a response message that defines the graphics<br>
    parameters for the decoder. this involves returning information about<br>
    available screen sizes, number of bits/color supported and the amount of<br>
    color detail supported. the escape sequence for the gce is defined as:<br>
    esc [ &gt; 0 g (g is lower case, spaces inserted for clarity)<br>
    (0x1b 0x5b 0x3e 0x30 0x67)<br>
    gif capabilities response<br>
    the gif capabilities response message is returned by an interactive<br>
    gif decoder and defines the decoder's display capabilities for all<br>
    graphics modes that are supported by the software. note that this can<br>
    also include graphics printers as well as a monitor screen. the general<br>
    format of this message is:<br>
    #version;protocol{;dev, width, height, color-bits, color-res}... &lt;cr&gt;<br>
    '#' - gcr identifier character (number sign)<br>
    version - gif format version number; initially '87a'<br>
    protocol='0' - no end-to-end protocol supported by decoder<br>
    transfer as direct 8-bit data stream.<br>
    protocol='1' - can use an error correction protocol to transfer gif data<br>
    interactively from the host directly to the display.<br>
    dev = '0' - screen parameter set follows<br>
    dev = '1' - printer parameter set follows<br>
    width - maximum supported display width in pixels<br>
    height - maximum supported display height in pixels<br>
    color-bits - number of bits per pixel supported. the number of<br>
    supported colors is therefore 2**color-bits.<br>
    color-res - number of bits per color component supported in the<br>
    hardware color palette. if color-res is '0' then no<br>
    hardware palette table is available.<br>
    note that all values in the gcr are returned as ascii decimal<br>
    numbers and the message is terminated by a carriage return character.<br>
    graphics interchange format (gif) page 11<br>
    appendix b - interactive sequences<br>
    the following gcr message describes three standard ega<br>
    configurations with no printer; the gif data stream can be processed<br>
    within an error correcting protocol:<br>
    #87a;1 ;0,320,200,4,0 ;0,640,200,2,2 ;0,640,350,4,2&lt;cr&gt;<br>
    enter gif graphics mode<br>
    two sequences are currently defined to invoke an interactive gif<br>
    decoder into action. the only difference between them is that different<br>
    output media are selected. these sequences are:<br>
    esc [ &gt; 1 g display gif image on screen<br>
    (0x1b 0x5b 0x3e 0x31 0x67)<br>
    esc [ &gt; 2 g display image directly to an attached graphics printer.<br>
    the image may optionally be displayed on the screen as<br>
    well.<br>
    (0x1b 0x5b 0x3e 0x32 0x67)<br>
    note that the 'g' character terminating each sequence is in lower<br>
    case.<br>
    interactive environment<br>
    the assumed environment for the transmission of gif image data from<br>
    an interactive application is a full 8-bit data stream from host to<br>
    micro. all 256 character codes must be transferrable. the establishing<br>
    of an 8-bit data path for communications will normally be taken care of<br>
    by the host application programs. it is however up to the receiving<br>
    communications programs supporting gif to be able to receive and pass on<br>
    all 256 8-bit codes to the gif decoder software.<br>

    the conversion of the image from a series of pixel values to a<br>
    transmitted or stored character stream involves several steps. in brief<br>
    these steps are:<br>
    1. establish the code size - define the number of bits needed to<br>
    represent the actual data.<br>
    2. compress the data - compress the series of image pixels to a series<br>
    of compression codes.<br>
    3. build a series of bytes - take the set of compression codes and<br>
    convert to a string of 8-bit bytes.<br>
    4. package the bytes - package sets of bytes into blocks preceeded by<br>
    character counts and output.<br>
    establish code size<br>
    the first byte of the gif raster data stream is a value indicating<br>
    the minimum number of bits required to represent the set of actual pixel<br>
    values. normally this will be the same as the number of color bits.<br>
    because of some algorithmic constraints however, black &amp; white images<br>
    which have one color bit must be indicated as having a code size of 2.<br>
    this code size value also implies that the compression codes must start<br>
    out one bit longer.<br>
    compression<br>
    the lzw algorithm converts a series of data values into a series of<br>
    codes which may be raw values or a code designating a series of values.<br>
    using text characters as an analogy, the output code consists of a<br>
    character or a code representing a string of characters.<br>

    appendix c - image packaging &amp; compression<br>
    the lzw algorithm used in gif matches algorithmically with the<br>
    standard lzw algorithm with the following differences:<br>
    1. a special clear code is defined which resets all<br>
    compression/decompression parameters and tables to a start-up state.<br>
    the value of this code is 2**&lt;code size&gt;. for example if the code<br>
    size indicated was 4 (image was 4 bits/pixel) the clear code value<br>
    would be 16 (10000 binary). the clear code can appear at any point<br>
    in the image data stream and therefore requires the lzw algorithm to<br>
    process succeeding codes as if a new data stream was starting.<br>
    encoders should output a clear code as the first code of each image<br>
    data stream.<br>
    2. an end of information code is defined that explicitly indicates the<br>
    end of the image data stream. lzw processing terminates when this<br>
    code is encountered. it must be the last code output by the encoder<br>
    for an image. the value of this code is &lt;clear code&gt;+1.<br>
    3. the first available compression code value is &lt;clear code&gt;+2.<br>
    4. the output codes are of variable length, starting at &lt;code size&gt;+1<br>
    bits per code, up to 12 bits per code. this defines a maximum code<br>
    value of 4095 (hex fff). whenever the lzw code value would exceed<br>
    the current code length, the code length is increased by one. the<br>
    packing/unpacking of these codes must then be altered to reflect the<br>
    new code length.<br>
    build 8-bit bytes<br>
    because the lzw compression used for gif creates a series of<br>
    variable length codes, of between 3 and 12 bits each, these codes must<br>
    be reformed into a series of 8-bit bytes that will be the characters<br>
    actually stored or transmitted. this provides additional compression of<br>
    the image. the codes are formed into a stream of bits as if they were<br>
    packed right to left and then picked off 8 bits at a time to be output.<br>
    assuming a character array of 8 bits per character and using 5 bit codes<br>
    to be packed, an example layout would be similar to:<br>
    byte n byte 5 byte 4 byte 3 byte 2 byte 1<br>
    +-.....-----+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+<br>
    | and so on |hhhhhggg|ggfffffe|eeeedddd|dcccccbb|bbbaaaaa|<br>
    +-.....-----+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+<br>
    note that the physical packing arrangement will change as the<br>
    number of bits per compression code change but the concept remains the<br>
    same.<br>
    package the bytes<br>
    once the bytes have been created, they are grouped into blocks for<br>
    output by preceeding each block of 0 to 255 bytes with a character count<br>
    byte. a block with a zero byte count terminates the raster data stream<br>
    for a given image. these blocks are what are actually output for the<br>
    graphics interchange format (gif) page 14<br>
    appendix c - image packaging &amp; compression<br>
    gif image. this block format has the side effect of allowing a decoding<br>
    program the ability to read past the actual image data if necessary by<br>
    reading block counts and then skipping over the data.<br>
    graphics interchange format (gif) page 15<br>
    appendix d - multiple image processing<br>
    since a gif data stream can contain multiple images, it is<br>
    necessary to describe processing and display of such a file. because<br>
    the image descriptor allows for placement of the image within the<br>
    logical screen, it is possible to define a sequence of images that may<br>
    each be a partial screen, but in total fill the entire screen. the<br>
    guidelines for handling the multiple image situation are:<br>
    1. there is no pause between images. each is processed immediately as<br>
    seen by the decoder.<br>
    2. each image explicitly overwrites any image already on the screen<br>
    inside of its window. the only screen clears are at the beginning<br>
    and end of the gif image process. see discussion on the gif<br>
    terminator.<br>
